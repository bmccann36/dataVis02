## concepts
latitude needs to be broadened to be less specific for grid to work
if it's too precise then practically every latitude will be it's on unique row on the grid,
however we want a range so that the more specific longitudes can be grouped in to categories, the category being the latitude

## IMPROVEMENTS
make it higher resolution i.e. more precise

make a dashboard that lets you modify the radius of data returned etc..

## TESTS
with smaller set hover mouse and see what data is returned, does it look correct?

## POSSIBLE CHANGE
make lat and possibly also long less precise
